## Project Description
# Business understanding
Customer attrition is a prevalent problem for many businesses, resulting in large financial losses. We intend to investigate customer churn or attrition in this project, which refers to the percentage of consumers that discontinue using a company's product or service within a specified time frame. Understanding the primary causes of customer churn can assist businesses in developing effective retention strategies to reduce customer attrition and boost revenue.

This project's dataset includes information about users' demographics, service usage, and billing information. We will use this dataset to conduct an exploratory data analysis in order to find patterns and trends linked to customer attrition. We will next use machine learning techniques to create a predictive model that will estimate the likelihood of a customer leaving the firm.

## objectives :

1.Investigate and display the data to uncover patterns and trends in customer attrition.

2.Using machine learning methods, create a predictive model to forecast the possibility of client attrition.

3.Determine the major churn indicators, such as client demographics, service usage, and billing information.

4.Create retention techniques to assist reduce client turnover while increasing customer loyalty.

5.Based on the model's results, assess the success of retention efforts and make recommendations for changes.

The project's outcome will provide valuable insights for Vodafone to understand customer churn and implement effective retention strategies to reduce customer attrition and increase revenue.

## Hypothesis
Null hypothesis :
Gender has a significant impact on churn for vodafone customers.

Alternative hypothesis :
Gender doesnot have a significant impact on churn for vodafone customers


## Questions
1. Which age group (Senior Citizen Column) paid the highest monthly charges?
2. Which gender has the highest count of churn ?
3. Which Internet Service is patronized the most?
4. How much total charge and monthly charge revenue does churners generate?
5. Which payment method is the most popular?

## Setup
...Install the required packages to be able to run the evaluation locally.
You need to have [`Python 3`](https://www.python.org/) on your system (**a Python version lower than 3.10**). Then you can clone this repo and being at the repo's `root :: repository_name> ...`  follow the steps below:

- Windows *(Python should be added to the Path variable of environment)*:
        
        python3 -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -r requirements.txt  

- Linux & MacOs:
        
        python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; python -m pip install --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

The both long command-lines have a same structure, they pipe multiple commands using the symbol **;** but you may manually execute them one after another.

1. **Create the Python's virtual environment** that isolates the required libraries of the project to avoid conflicts;
2. **Activate the Python's virtual environment** so that the Python kernel & libraries will be those of the isolated environment;
3. **Upgrade Pip, the installed libraries/packages manager** to have the up-to-date version that will work correctly;
4. **Install the required libraries/packages** listed in the `requirements.txt` file so that it will be allow to import them into the python's scripts and notebooks without any issue.

## App Execution
...This evaluation will be automatically grade, so please follow the instructions carefully. 

You can run this command bellow being at the root of the repository to be sure your solutions are the good ones before to push your solutions.
```command
